# Tweet-Emotion-Recognition
The data contains 6 different emotions and we will try to predict what kind of emotion specific tweet from the data represents. 
here in this project we've used Recurrent Neural network to get the prediction.


Objective: To predict the emotions from the tweets.

Steps:
we've implemented following steps:
Tokenizing the data
Padding and truncating the tweets
Preparing the models
Creating and Training the Recurrent Neural Network


Results:
The Training accuracy obtained was 98.22%
The testing accuracy obtained was 87.4%
